# Code for the C2S hydrologist technical assessment

My writeup for the technical assessment is here: `JonathanFrame_C2S_technical_challenge.pdf`

Well actually the return period analysis was done using this public Matlab code: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/22628-log-pearson-flood-flow-frequency-using-usgs-17b

Once those return periods were calculated, here is my code for analysis of return periods: `analysis_code_c2s_tulsa_2019.ipynb`
